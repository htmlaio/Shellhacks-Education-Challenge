    <p>The United States and the Soviet Union began developing intercontinental ballistic missiles, and in 1962 the
      Soviets began secretly installing missiles in Cuba that could be used to launch nuclear attacks on U.S. cities.
      This sparked the Cuban missile crisis (1962), a confrontation that brought the two superpowers to the brink of war
      before an agreement was reached to withdraw the missiles.</p>
    <p>The Cuban missile crisis showed that neither the United States nor the Soviet Union were ready to use nuclear
      weapons for fear of the other’s retaliation (and thus of mutual atomic annihilation). The two superpowers soon
      signed the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty of 1963, which banned aboveground nuclear weapons testing. But the crisis also
      hardened the Soviets’ determination never again to be humiliated by their military inferiority, and they began a
      buildup of both conventional and strategic forces that the United States was forced to match for the next 25
      years. </p>
    <p>Throughout the Cold War the United States and the Soviet Union avoided direct military confrontation in Europe
      and engaged in actual combat operations only to keep allies from defecting to the other side or to overthrow them
      after they had done so. Thus, the Soviet Union sent troops to preserve communist rule in East Germany (1953),
      Hungary (1956), Czechoslovakia (1968), and Afghanistan (1979). For its part, the United States helped overthrow a
      left-wing government in Guatemala (1954), supported an unsuccessful invasion of Cuba (1961), invaded the Dominican
      Republic (1965) and Grenada (1983), and undertook a long (1964–75) and unsuccessful effort to prevent communist
      North Vietnam from bringing South Vietnam under its rule (see Vietnam War).</p>
