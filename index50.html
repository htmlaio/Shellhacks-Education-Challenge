    <p>The Cold War reached its peak in 1948–53. In this period the Soviets unsuccessfully blockaded the Western-held
      sectors of West Berlin (1948–49); the United States and its European allies formed the North Atlantic Treaty
      Organization (NATO), a unified military command to resist the Soviet presence in Europe (1949); the Soviets
      exploded their first atomic warhead (1949), thus ending the American monopoly on the atomic bomb; the Chinese
      communists came to power in mainland China (1949); and the Soviet-supported communist government of North Korea
      invaded U.S.-supported South Korea in 1950, setting off an indecisive Korean War that lasted until 1953.

    <p>From 1953 to 1957 Cold War tensions relaxed somewhat, largely owing to the death of the longtime Soviet dictator
      Joseph Stalin in 1953; nevertheless, the standoff remained. A unified military organization among the Soviet-bloc
      countries, the Warsaw Pact, was formed in 1955; and West Germany was admitted into NATO that same year. </p>
