    <p>Following the surrender of Nazi Germany in May 1945 near the close of World War II, the uneasy wartime alliance
      between the United States and Great Britain on the one hand and the Soviet Union on the other began to unravel.
      The end of World War II set the stage for the Cold War -- the struggle between communism and capitalism that
      pitted East against West and pushed the world to the brink of nuclear war. (CNN)</p>
    <p>By 1948 the Soviets had installed left-wing governments in the countries of eastern Europe that had been
      liberated by the Red Army. The Americans and the British feared the permanent Soviet domination of eastern Europe
      and the threat of Soviet-influenced communist parties coming to power in the democracies of western Europe. The
      Soviets, on the other hand, were determined to maintain control of eastern Europe in order to safeguard against
      any possible renewed threat from Germany, and they were intent on spreading communism worldwide, largely for
      ideological reasons. </p>
    <p>The Cold War had solidified by 1947â€“48, when U.S. aid provided under the Marshall Plan to western Europe had
      brought those countries under American influence and the Soviets had installed openly communist regimes in eastern
      Europe. (Britannica)</p>
