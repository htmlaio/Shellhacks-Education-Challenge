# Shellhacks-Education-Challenge 
During the 36-hour Shellhacks Hackathon, I pursued Google and Microsoft's coding challenges (commented below). While I was able to implement base data, I hoped to be able to produce more. I read the project descriptions and planned to create a sort of search engine for world history, which would filter out unprofessional, non-peer reviewed, generally bad, .net articles. This would require I stay a little more than 36-hours since this is my first hackathon. So I decided on an interactive data visualization project with Python. My outline included an interactive map, an interactive timeline, and bar graphs. When hovered over a nation or region, the interactive map would display ways in which the Cold War affected it. I figured this would be cool because my favorite thing about learning is being able to connect the pieces and understanding the bigger picture. Seeing how the Cold War affected the world, is great because its typically summarized to a political tension between the United States and (former) "Soviet Union". I am still working to complete my Bokeh pandas_groupby_colormapped bar chart to represent military and civilian deaths by nation during the Korean War, Vietnam War, and Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan. Due to my time limitations with all projects being due 9/17/23 at 11am, I was not able to submit a complete project but I plan to keep working since I love this project (before all, I am a political science major, lol!)

For clarification purposes I would like to add that I am not entirely comfortable with how this repository works but from what I understand, you'll have to open each file individually. "Index.html" is my main website. "Index40.html", "Index50.html", "Index60.html", "Index70.html", "Decline.html" are buttons at the bottom of the page taking you to pages two through six of the site.

Thank you for reading and reviewing my code!
